# 🚀 Simplified Setup Guide - Shared Development Environment

This guide will help you set up the Freelancer Marketplace application on your local machine using our **shared development database**.

## 🌟 What Makes This Special

This project uses a **shared MongoDB Atlas database** for collaborative development:
- ✅ **No database setup required** - Everything is pre-configured
- ✅ **Real-time collaboration** - See changes from other developers instantly
- ✅ **Shared data** - All services, applications, and users are shared
- ✅ **True team development** - Experience working with live, shared data

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **NPM** (v8 or higher) - Comes with Node.js
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Internet Connection** - Required for shared database access

## 🔧 Super Simple Setup (3 Steps!)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bishnu9798/INFINITY-CODERS-R1-CIH-2.0.git
cd INFINITY-CODERS-R1-CIH-2.0
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ..
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the Application

```bash
# Option 1: Start both servers simultaneously (Recommended)
npm run start:full

# Option 2: Start manually in separate terminals
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd ..
npm run dev
```

## 🎉 That's It!

No environment configuration, no database setup, no credentials to manage!
The application will automatically connect to our shared development database.

## ✅ Verify Setup

1. **Check Backend Health**:
   - Open: http://localhost:3002/api/health
   - Should show: `{"status":"OK","database":"Connected"}`

2. **Check Frontend**:
   - Open: http://localhost:5173/
   - Should show the landing page

3. **Test Shared Database**:
   - Open: http://localhost:3002/api/stats
   - Should show database statistics with shared data

4. **Verify Real-time Collaboration**:
   - Register a new account
   - Post a service or apply for one
   - Your data will be visible to all other developers!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### 🚨 **"Network error - cannot connect to server"**

This is the most common issue. **Quick fix:**

1. **Wait 15 seconds** after starting the application
2. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Check frontend terminal** for the actual port (might be 5174 or 5175)

### 📋 **Full Troubleshooting Guide**

For complete troubleshooting steps, see: **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**

### 🔧 **Quick Diagnostic Tools**

```bash
# Check system health
check-infinity-workspace.bat

# Restart everything
stop-infinity-workspace.bat
start-infinity-workspace.bat
```

### ⚡ **Most Common Solutions**

1. **Backend not ready**: Wait 15 seconds for MongoDB connection
2. **Wrong port**: Check frontend terminal for actual port number
3. **Cache issues**: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. **Port conflicts**: Run `stop-infinity-workspace.bat` first

## 🎉 Success!
